### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Marco :man_technologist:**. Developer based in MÃ©xico

I strongly believe that technology is a powerful tool to turn ideas into valuable, scalable solutions. I focus on building reliable, efficient applications from the backend to the frontend.

I'm constantly learning, because I know the tech world moves fastâ€”and I aim to move with it. I care about clean code, solid architecture, and delivering results that inspire trust and reflect a deep understanding of the product.

**Code with purpose, build with vision**. :nerd_face:

**You can find me :earth_americas:**
