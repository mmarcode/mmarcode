### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Marco :man_technologist:**. Software developer based in Mexico

With over 10 years of experience turning ideas into scalable, reliable, and efficient applications.

I specialize in full-stack development, building clean, maintainable solutions from backend to frontend. Iâ€™m passionate about clean code, thoughtful architecture, and delivering results that solve real problems.

I believe in continuous learning and staying ahead in a fast-evolving tech landscape. My goal is to build software that not only worksâ€”but works beautifully, earns trust, and creates impact.

**Code with purpose, build with vision**. :nerd_face:

**You can find me :earth_americas:**
